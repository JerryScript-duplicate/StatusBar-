		<p>This package contains the necessary {@link android.app.Service} and {@link android.app.Activity}s to function. It works by creating a background service with a window that is placed above the default system status bar. There it displays a number of system indicators including time, signal strength, Wi-Fi, bluetooth, and more. Which indicators do and do not display are customizable.</p>
